## Notion Data Science Internship Take-Home Assignment

My implementation and approach to Notion's Summer 2025 Data Science Internship take-home assignment.

1. Individual queries are stored in `sql/` folder.
2. `notebook.ipynb` is where the analysis is conducted.
3. Original `db.sqlite` file is not included in the repository for confidentiality concerns (the repo is private, but just in case).

Feel free to shoot me a message at es4281@columbia.edu if you have any questions or feedback!
