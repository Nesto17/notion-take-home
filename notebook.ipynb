    "1. One customer can have multiple subscriptions (in theory), and thus, cancellation and activation are tied to subscriptions, not customers.\n",
    "2. Therefore, when the question asks \"How many customers are we losing\" – I'd rephrase it as \"How many subscriptions are we losing\". In simpler terms, I used subscription as the level of granularity.\n",
    "3. I saw it this way to prevent inconsistency during the analysis. For example, since a customer can have two different subscriptions (one still continuing to next month and the other one just issued cancellation), then, if I were tasked to compute the churn rate of the customer instead of a subscription, it'd be difficult and overly complex.\n",
    "4. This is a fake software product, but if I can tie this to Notion, I'd see one subscription will directly correlate to one Notion workspace (since one customer can have multiple workspaces).\n",
    "5. All analyses are conducted within the year 2018 only."
